# Interfacing an 8051 Microcontroller with LCD

This is an educational project written to have a keypad entry display on an LCD screen.
Assembly files were given to be translated into C code and then implemented to have the 8051
interact with the microcontroller of the LCD. The 8051 handles interupts from a decoder tied 
to the keypad. 

#### Devices Compatible

- 8051 microcontroller
- LCD dot matrix with HD44780 Controller
- 4x3 numeric keypad and MM74C922 16-key decoder

#### Using this repository

Just upload the [LCD_Interfacing_Controller](https://github.com/Dulatr/8051-LCD-Interfacing/blob/master/8051/LCD_Interfacing_Controller.c) file to the 8051 and turn it on!
